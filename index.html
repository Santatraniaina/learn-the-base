                    <p>
                        At its heart, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
                    </p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Before starting this module, you don't need any previous <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

                                Covers the absolute basics of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page is structured and how an <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to get you interested!

                                The head of an <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page &lt;title&gt;, links to CSS (if you want to style your <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).

                                One of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>'s main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.

                                Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link and discusses best practices for links.

                                There are many other elements in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> for formatting text that we didn't get to in the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text fundamentals article. The elements here are less well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article, you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.

                                As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is also used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", or "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to represent this structure.
